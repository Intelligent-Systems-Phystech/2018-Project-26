  abstract       = {This paper proposes a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm based on the strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) using the gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers on smartphones. In addition to using a gravity vector, magnetic field vector, and quasi-static attitude, this algorithm employs a gait model and motion constraint to provide pseudo-measurements (i.e., three-dimensional velocity and two-dimensional position increment) instead of using only pseudo-velocity measurement for a more robust PDR algorithm. Several walking tests show that the advanced algorithm can maintain good position estimation compare to the existing SINS-based PDR method in the four basic smartphone positions, i.e., handheld, calling near the ear, swaying in the hand, and in a pants pocket. In addition, we analyze the navigation performance difference between the advanced algorithm and the existing gait-model-based PDR algorithm from three aspects, i.e., heading estimation, position estimation, and step detection failure, in the four basic phone positions. Test results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better position estimation when a pedestrian holds a smartphone in a swaying hand and step detection is unsuccessful.},

  abstract = {Indoor pedestrian tracking extends location-based services to indoor environments where GPS signal is rarely detected. Typical indoor localization method is Wi-Fi-based positioning system, which is practical showing accuracy and extending coverage. However, it involves significant costs of installing and managing wireless access points. A practical indoor pedestrian-tracking approach should consider the absence of any infrastructure or pretrained database. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning, SmartPDR, which tracks pedestrians through typical dead reckoning approach using data from inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartPDR does not require any complex and expensive additional device or infrastructure that most existing pedestrian tracking systems rely on. The proposed system was implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones and the performance was evaluated in several buildings. Despite inherent localization errors from low-cost noisy sensors and complicated human movements, SmartPDR successfully tracks indoor user's location, which is confirmed from the experimental results with reasonable location accuracy. Indoor pedestrian tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors can be a promising methodology validating its practical usage through real deployment.},

  Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8,730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.}

abstract={Time series classification is an important task in time series data mining, and has attracted great interests and tremendous efforts during last decades. However, it remains a challenging problem due to the nature of time series data: high dimensionality, large in data size and updating continuously. The deep learning techniques are explored to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches. Specifically, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed for time series classification. Different from other feature-based classification approaches, CNN can discover and extract the suitable internal structure to generate deep features of the input time series automatically by using convolution and pooling operations. Two groups of experiments are conducted on simulated data sets and eight groups of experiments are conducted on real-world data sets from different application domains. The final experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series classification in terms of the classification accuracy and noise tolerance.},

abstract={Location estimation and navigation, especially on smartphones has shown great progress in the past decade due to its low cost and ability to work without additional infrastructure. However, a challenge is the positioning, both in terms of step detection, step length approximation as well as heading estimation, which must be accurate and robust, even when the use of the device is varied in terms of placement or orientation. In this paper, we propose a scheme for retrieving relevant information to detect steps and to estimate the correct step length from raw inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This approach uses Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (BLSTM-RNNs). Designed to take contextual information into account, the network can process data gathered from different positions, resulting in a system, which is invariant with respect to transformation and distortions of the input patterns. An experimental evaluation on a dataset produced from 10 individuals demonstrates that this new approach achieves significant improvements over previous attempts and increase the current state-of-the-art results even in the presence of variations and degradations. We achieved a mean classification rate of 98.5% and a standard deviation of 0.70 for 10000 different test sequences and an average error of 1.45% regarding the step length. Thus is the best result on the task gathered in the experiments compared with competing techniques.},
