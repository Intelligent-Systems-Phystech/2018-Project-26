  abstract       = {This paper proposes a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm based on the strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) using the gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers on smartphones. In addition to using a gravity vector, magnetic field vector, and quasi-static attitude, this algorithm employs a gait model and motion constraint to provide pseudo-measurements (i.e., three-dimensional velocity and two-dimensional position increment) instead of using only pseudo-velocity measurement for a more robust PDR algorithm. Several walking tests show that the advanced algorithm can maintain good position estimation compare to the existing SINS-based PDR method in the four basic smartphone positions, i.e., handheld, calling near the ear, swaying in the hand, and in a pants pocket. In addition, we analyze the navigation performance difference between the advanced algorithm and the existing gait-model-based PDR algorithm from three aspects, i.e., heading estimation, position estimation, and step detection failure, in the four basic phone positions. Test results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better position estimation when a pedestrian holds a smartphone in a swaying hand and step detection is unsuccessful.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, IMU and magnetometer models that enable pedestrian dead-reckoning without step detection or zero velocity updates on hand-held devices such as smartphones are proposed. The models are suitable for usage with any standard Bayesian filtering or smoothing technique and thus, do not require customized estimators. The method is evaluated in a real scenario using a dataset of approximately three minutes with a trajectory length of 302m. It is found that the overall shape of the estimated trajectory matches well with the GPS reference trajectory with an estimated trajectory length of 293m. Some problems in the heading estimation are observed.},

  abstract = {Indoor pedestrian tracking extends location-based services to indoor environments where GPS signal is rarely detected. Typical indoor localization method is Wi-Fi-based positioning system, which is practical showing accuracy and extending coverage. However, it involves significant costs of installing and managing wireless access points. A practical indoor pedestrian-tracking approach should consider the absence of any infrastructure or pretrained database. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning, SmartPDR, which tracks pedestrians through typical dead reckoning approach using data from inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartPDR does not require any complex and expensive additional device or infrastructure that most existing pedestrian tracking systems rely on. The proposed system was implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones and the performance was evaluated in several buildings. Despite inherent localization errors from low-cost noisy sensors and complicated human movements, SmartPDR successfully tracks indoor user's location, which is confirmed from the experimental results with reasonable location accuracy. Indoor pedestrian tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors can be a promising methodology validating its practical usage through real deployment.},
