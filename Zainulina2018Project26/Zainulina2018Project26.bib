  abstract = {Indoor pedestrian tracking extends location-based services to indoor environments where GPS signal is rarely detected. Typical indoor localization method is Wi-Fi-based positioning system, which is practical showing accuracy and extending coverage. However, it involves significant costs of installing and managing wireless access points. A practical indoor pedestrian-tracking approach should consider the absence of any infrastructure or pretrained database. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning, SmartPDR, which tracks pedestrians through typical dead reckoning approach using data from inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartPDR does not require any complex and expensive additional device or infrastructure that most existing pedestrian tracking systems rely on. The proposed system was implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones and the performance was evaluated in several buildings. Despite inherent localization errors from low-cost noisy sensors and complicated human movements, SmartPDR successfully tracks indoor user's location, which is confirmed from the experimental results with reasonable location accuracy. Indoor pedestrian tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors can be a promising methodology validating its practical usage through real deployment.},

The models are suitable for usage with any standard Bayesian filtering or smoothing technique and thus, do not require customized estimators. The method is evaluated in a real scenario using a dataset of approximately three minutes with a trajectory length of 302m. It is found that the overall shape of the estimated trajectory matches well with the GPS reference trajectory with an estimated trajectory length of 293m. Some problems in the heading estimation are observed.},

It comprises of regression and classification tasks as well as dimension reduction techniques and modeling tools. The underlying assumption of all PLS methods is that the observed data is generated by a system or process which is driven by a small number of latent (not directly observed or measured) variables. Projections of the observed data to its latent structure by means of PLS was developed by Herman Wold and coworkers [48,49,52].},
